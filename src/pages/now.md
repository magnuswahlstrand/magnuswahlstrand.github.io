It’s 2022. The world is no longer in lockdown. I’m working from home from my house outside of Stockholm. My son is one year old.

Some things I’m working on:
* **Learning Python, and SQLAlchemy**
* **Becoming stronger**
* **Write a new blog post per month**
* **Learning "Stairways to Heaven" on guitar**

This is a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">now</a> page, and if you have your own site, <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">you can make one</a>, too!
