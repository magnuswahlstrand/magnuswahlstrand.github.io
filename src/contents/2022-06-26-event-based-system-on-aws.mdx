In this post I will build a small [event-driven system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture) with Go. It will be serverless app with an API Gateway in front. I will use [AWS EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) as message bus that serves as glue between our components and the app will be deployed using [Serverless Stack ](https://sst.dev/).

<div class="b-8 l-16 max-w-xl mx-auto">
  <img src="/img/event-based-system-on-aws/teaser.png" alt="Event-based system" class=""/>
</div>


## Overview

Our overall goal is quite simple. We want to build a simple system where we can have things create events (producers) and other things receive those events (consumers). To tie the producers and consumers together we need a message bus. We will use [AWS EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) for this purpose.

In this tutorial, we will build an order taking app. On the one side, orders are placed through a public API endpoint `POST /orders`. The handler for that endpoint is a Lambda function that "creates" order by publishing them to EventBridge. It in turn is configured to route messages to our consumers, two Lambda functions. **CreateInvoice** and **LogEvents** will receive `order.created` events and log them to standard out, just to showcase the broadcasting of events.

<Caption> Target architecture </Caption>

Our app is deployed to AWS using my new favorite tool: [Serverless Stack](https://sst.dev/) (SST). It has great [CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) constructs for quick development, and gives us hot reload of the Lambda functions. Great!

## Project set up

First we need to bootstrap our project. The [SST CLI](https://sst.dev/) will do most of the heavy lifting. Since most of our application code is Go, I use the **starters/go-starter** template.

```
npx create-sst@latest --template=starters/go-starter eventbus
cd eventbus
```
Our directory now looks as follows.
```
> tree -a -L 2
.
├── .env
├── .gitignore
├── .vscode
│   └── launch.json
├── package.json
├── services
│   ├── functions
│   │  └── lambda.go
│   ├── go.mod
│   └── go.sum
├── sst.json
├── stacks
│   ├── MyStack.ts
│   └── index.ts
├── tsconfig.json
└── vitest.config.ts
```
In this tutorial, we are interested in two parts
* `./stack/MyStack.ts` - This is where our SST/CDK stack is defined. It will define the infrastructure for API Gateway, EventBridge and our Lambda functions.
* `./services/functions/` - Here we define our Lambda functions. The go-starter template comes with a single function called `lambda.go`.

We also install [Dave Cheney](https://dave.cheney.net/)'s package [go-spew](https://github.com/davecgh/go-spew). It is a Go package to dump things to the logs. I often use it to explore what data is passed around in a new service, in this case AWS EventBridge.

```
cd eventbus/services
go get github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew
```

With everything in place, we can deploy our initial stack

```
npm install
npm start
```

Output:
```

## Consuming events

Now we can start building! First out we will get the **_event consuming_** to work. Our setup will look like this:

1. A way of producing messages
2. An event bus with routing rules
3. A Lambda function to receive the events

![consume](/img/event-based-system-on-aws/consume.png)

<Caption>
**Goal:** produce events from the terminal, through EventBridge and consume in our Lambda function
</Caption>

First up, let's create a serverless function that listens to events from the event bus. SST makes this easy for us! All we need to do is to replace the initial stack in `./stack/MyStack.ts` with the following:

```go
import {EventBus, StackContext} from "@serverless-stack/resources";

export function Stack({stack}: StackContext) {
    // 1. Create event bus
    const bus = new EventBus(stack, "EventBus", {})

    // 2. Add set up event routing rules
    bus.addRules(stack, {
        "order_created": {
            pattern: {
                detailType: ["order.created"],
            },
            targets: {
                function: "functions/log_events.go"
            }
        }
    })

	// 3. Output the event bus name
    stack.addOutputs({
        BusName: bus.eventBusName
    });
}
```
Let's break this down.

1. We create our event bus using `EventBus` from `@serverless-stack/resources`. This is a higher order CDK construct that simplifies our set up. This create a new custom EventBridge bus.
2. Next, we add routing rules for events. This rule send any messages that have the `detailType` == `"order.created"` and forwards them to all our `targets`. For now, we only have a single function at `functions/log_events.go`
3. Finally, we output the name of the created event.

We haven't actually created our function yet. Create a new file called `functions/log_events.go`.
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/events"
	"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda"
	"github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew"
)

func LogHandler(request events.CloudWatchEvent) error {
	fmt.Printf("received event of type %q\n", request.DetailType)
	spew.Dump(request)
	return nil
}

func main() {
	lambda.Start(LogHandler)
}
```

This function receives an event of type CloudWatchEvent (this is the event format sent over EventBridge) and logs it to standard out using `go-spew` that we installed earlier. We will see it in action.

### Testing the event consumer

Before we run our tests, make sure that the SST CLI is still running. If not, start it with `npm start` in the root folder. Next, we create a file with a single event payload in a file called `order_created.json`.

```json
[
  {
    "Source": "terminal",
    "Detail": "{ \"amount\": 999, \"line_items\": [] }",
    "EventBusName": "magnus-eventbus-EventBus",
    "DetailType": "order.created"
  }
]
```
This is the minimal payload (I believe). Full definition [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-events.html).

```
aws --region us-east-1 events put-events --entries file://order_created.json
```

You should see something like this to indicate that the publishing was successful:
```json
{
    "FailedEntryCount": 0,
    "Entries": [
        {
            "EventId": "4d2d7ae8-57e4-5e17-97be-dcd98c22014b"
        }
    ]
}
```

If you open the terminal with the SST CLI, you should see our the function `functions/log_events.go` was invoked, and the whole payload was logged!

```

 }
}
```

As you can see, this is mostly the same event as we sent from using `aws events put-events`. The most interesting fields here are
* `DetailType`: **order.created**, this is the field that we use for routing.
* `Detail` contains our payload. In Go, reprepsented as `json.RawMessage/[]byte`.

Consuming events is working! 🎉

## Producing events

Now we can work on our _**event producing**_. We will work on the part of the left here.

![consume](/img/event-based-system-on-aws/producer.png)

Once again, SST makes this easy.
1. We import `Api` from `@serverless-stack/resources`.
2. Our route is defined in the props under `routers`, we point it to a new function defined in the file `create_order.go`.
3. We add permission to publish to the event bus, and define the environment variable **EVENT_BUS_NAME**, needed when publishing events.

```diff
-import {EventBus, StackContext} from "@serverless-stack/resources";
+import {EventBus, Api, StackContext} from "@serverless-stack/resources";

 export function Stack({stack}: StackContext) {
    const bus = new EventBus(stack, "EventBus", {})

    bus.addRules(stack, {
        "order_created": {
            pattern: {
                detailType: ["order.created"],
            },
            targets: {
                function: "functions/log_events.go"
            }
        }
    })

+    const api = new Api(stack, "api", {
+        routes: {
+            "POST /order": "functions/create_order.go",
+        },
+        defaults: {
+            function: {
+                permissions: [bus],
+                environment: {
+                    EVENT_BUS_NAME: bus.eventBusName
+                }
+            },
+
+        },
+    });
+
     stack.addOutputs({
+        ApiEndpoint: api.url,
         BusName: bus.eventBusName
     });
 }
```

Next we define our new function. Create a new file called `functions/create_order.go`.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"encoding/json"
	"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/events"
	"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda"
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws"
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config"
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/cloudwatchevents"
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/cloudwatchevents/types"
	"os"
)

var busName = os.Getenv("EVENT_BUS_NAME")

type CreateOrderRequest struct {
	Amount    int64    `json:"amount"`
	LineItems []string `json:"line_items"`
}

func CreateOrderHandler(request events.APIGatewayProxyRequest) error {
	// 1. Unmarshal request
	var req CreateOrderRequest
	if err := json.Unmarshal([]byte(request.Body), &req); err != nil {
		return err
	}

	// 2. Set up EventBridge client
	cfg, err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(context.TODO())
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	client := cloudwatchevents.NewFromConfig(cfg)

	// 3. Marshal order into JSON again
	b, err := json.Marshal(req)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	// 4. Publish events to EventBridge
	_, err = client.PutEvents(context.Background(),
		&cloudwatchevents.PutEventsInput{
			Entries: []types.PutEventsRequestEntry{
				{
					EventBusName: aws.String(busName),
					Source:       aws.String("create_order_fn"),

					DetailType: aws.String("order.created"),
					Detail:     aws.String(string(b)),
				},
			},
		})
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	return nil
}

func main() {
	lambda.Start(CreateOrderHandler)
}
```
Here we do the following:

1. Unmarshal the request body from the API gateway into `CreateOrderRequest`.
2. Create an EventBridge client
3. Marshal the JSON we want to send in our event
4. Send our event to EventBridge

<Sidenote title="Note:">
We could probably get away with creating a global client and re-use that between requests. During testing, I got an authentication error due to stale credentials. This might only be a test environment problem, but for now we will create the client on every request.

</Sidenote>

Once again, let SST deploy all updates.

### Testing the event producer

Now we are ready to test our new event producer. There are at least two ways of doing this.
* Use curl, or your favorite HTTP client and make the request. _Remember to update the API gateway URL._
```
POST https://4ty44qcuya.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/order
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "amount": 999,
  "line_items": ["food", "shelter"]
}
```
* Or, the option I used: go to the SST console and make the request.
  ![SST console](/img/event-based-system-on-aws/sst-console.png)

Going back to the terminal, we see the result:

```bash
# 1. create_order invoked via the API gateway

 }
}
ea5ecb52-90f0-416a-aa69-1645ab6b965e RESPONSE null
```

Not only did we test event producing, but we ended up consuming the events as well! 🍾

## Adding a new consumer

Now, imagine the following scenario. The accounting department contacts us:
> We are happy that we have started receiving a lot of orders in our system, but where are the corresponding invoices?

We have forgotten our second event consumer, `CreateInvoice` 😱.

Lucky for us, one of the benefit of event based systems with a message bus, is that it (should be) easy to add a new consumers to the system, based on new requirements. First, we create our new function as `functions/create_invoice.go`:

```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/events"
	"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda"
)

type OrderCreatedEvent struct {
	Amount    int64    `json:"amount"`
	LineItems []string `json:"line_items"`
}

func CreateInvoiceHandler(request events.CloudWatchEvent) error {
	var event OrderCreatedEvent
	if err := json.Unmarshal(request.Detail, &event); err != nil {
		return err
	}

	fmt.Printf("received event of type %q\n", request.DetailType)
	fmt.Println("creating invoice for event", event)
	return nil
}

func main() {
	lambda.Start(CreateInvoiceHandler)
}
```
Then we add it as a target for our stack:

```diff
    bus.addRules(stack, {
        "order_created": {
            pattern: {
                detailType: ["order.created"],
            },
            targets: {
-                function: "functions/log_events.go"
+                function: "functions/log_events.go",
+                invoiceFunction: "functions/create_invoice.go",
            }
        }
    })
```

Now all we need to do is to create a new order
```bash
# 1. create_order invoked via the API gateway
60647f24-3e36-438c-964e-e6644e472f84 REQUEST magnus-eventbus-Stack-apiLambdaPOSTorderCF2979AB-jZgSzQgXMeRR [functions/create.go] invoked by API POST /order
60647f24-3e36-438c-964e-e6644e472f84 RESPONSE null

# 2. create_invoice.go invoked (by event from event bus)

# 3. log_events.go invoked (by event from event bus)

...
525f7e61-e03a-4a31-a58b-4d9e9593bc91 RESPONSE null

# 4. Our invoice
received event of type "order.created"
creating invoice for event {999 [food shelter]}
5b939ded-8715-4ad4-90e4-775d783893b4 RESPONSE null
```

If we forward this log to the accounting department, they will surely be happy!

# Conclusion

We have built an event-based system using Go and AWS services.  SST helps us quickly set up the infrastructure, and simplifies things like IAM permissions and propagating environment variables.

There are a few **improvements** we could make to our system. One would be to put SQS queues between EventBridge and our event consuming Lambda function. This would make retries possible if the functions are unavailable for some reason. Another improvement could be to let our event consumers actually do something useful, like storing data to a DynamoDB table or sending e-mail notifications using SNS. But that's for another time.
