      <description>My name is Magnus Wahlstrand. I am an engineer, based in Stockholm Sweden. I love programming.
I enjoy developing things that are easy to maintain and observe long term. If shortcuts are needed, I believe in taking the time to clean up afterwards to keep the quality of the code base high over time.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s 2021. The world is still in lockdown. I&amp;rsquo;m working from home from my girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s apartment in Stockholm.
Some things I&amp;rsquo;m working on:
 Write every day Read 3-4 technical articles per week of blogs that I enjoy, and spend some time to analyze their style. As with many things in life, having good role models to emulate is great, before making their style my own. Take a walk every day   This is a now page, and if you have your own site, you can make one, too!</description>
