      <description>My name is Magnus Wahlstrand. I am an engineer, based in Stockholm Sweden. I love programming.
I enjoy developing things that are easy to maintain and observe long term. If shortcuts are needed, I believe in taking the time to clean up afterwards to keep the quality of the code base high over time.
